# 🧠 Workshop 3: Machine Learning & Data Streaming – Happiness Score Prediction
# Developed by:
# Luis Angel Garcia (2230177)

This project implements a full Machine Learning pipeline combined with real-time data processing using Kafka. A regression model is trained to predict the Happiness Score of various countries using data from 2015 to 2019. A streaming system processes the data and stores predictions and features in a database.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib
* Kafka + kafka-python
* SQLite
* Docker + Docker Compose

---

## 🔄 Project Flow

1. Load 5 CSV files with yearly happiness data.
2. Standardize and clean the data.
3. Train a regression model with 70-30 split.
4. Stream the cleaned dataset using Kafka (producer).
5. Consume the data, predict scores in real-time.
6. Store features and predictions in a database.

---

## 🧹 EDA and ETL

* Detected differences in columns between years.
* Renamed and standardized columns (`GDP`, `Health`, etc.).
* Dropped unnecessary columns (`Region`, `Standard Error`).
* Imputed missing values (`Trust`, `Dystopia`).

## 🧠 Model Training

Three models were trained to compare performance:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Huber Regressor**

### 📊 Metrics Comparison:

**Linear Regression**
- R² Score: 0.9863
- RMSE: 0.1307
- MAE: 0.0990
- MSE: 0.0171

**Ridge Regression**
- R² Score: 0.9862
- RMSE: 0.1313
- MAE: 0.0986
- MSE: 0.0172

**Huber Regressor**
- R² Score: 0.9859
- RMSE: 0.1328
- MAE: 0.0938
- MSE: 0.0176

**Accuracy (±0.3 tolerance)**
- Linear Regression: 97.02%
- Ridge Regression: 97.02%
- Huber Regressor: 96.6%

➡️ **Final Decision**: Linear Regression was selected due to its simplicity, interpretability, and strong performance.

## 🔁 Kafka Streaming

### Producer (`kafka/producer.py`)

* Reads from `dataset_limpio.csv`
* Sends each row to Kafka topic `happiness_topic` (excluding `Country` and `Score`)

### Consumer (`kafka/consumer.py`)

* Receives data from Kafka
* Applies `scaler.pkl`, predicts with `happiness_model.pkl`
* Inserts results into `predictions.db`

---

## 💾 SQLite Database

* Database: `predictions.db`
* Table: `predictions`
* Stores:
  * Input features
  * Year
  * Predicted `Happiness Score`

### Query results

Run:

```bash
python database/consultar_db.py
```

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Generated plot: Predicted vs Actual  
Conclusion: The predictions closely follow the ideal line. No major error trends or outliers.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd workshop_003
```

### 2. Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .env\Scriptsctivate on Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the notebook to generate model and dataset

Before starting Kafka, open the notebook and run it to generate the following:
- `models/happiness_model.pkl`
- `models/scaler.pkl`
- `data/dataset_limpio.csv`

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/eda_etl.ipynb
```

### 5. Start Kafka

```bash
cd kafka
docker-compose up -d
```

### 6. Run producer and consumer

In one terminal:

```bash
python kafka/consumer.py
```

In another terminal:

```bash
python kafka/producer.py
```

### 7. View predictions

```bash
python database/consultar_db.py
```
